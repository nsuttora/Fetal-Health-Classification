# Fetal Health Classifier
> The reduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress. The UN expects that by 2030, countries will end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce underâ€‘5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.

> Parallel to the notion of child mortality is maternal mortality, which accounts for 295,000 deaths during and following pregnancy and childbirth (as of 2017). The vast majority of these deaths (94%) occurred in low-resource settings, where most could have been prevented.

> In light of what was mentioned, Cardiotocograms (CTGs) are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions, and more. CTGs have a high degree of sensitivity but a low level of specificity, meaning that they are very good at identifying which fetuses are well, but are poor at identifying which fetuses are unwell.
